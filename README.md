**Challenge**

1. If users try to visit a URL that isn’t allowed, show an alert saying it’s blocked.

2. Try making two new toolbar items with the titles Back and Forward. You should make them use webView.goBack and webView.goForward.

3. For more of a challenge, try changing the initial view controller to a table view like in project 1, where users can choose their website from a list rather than just having the first in the array loaded up front.
